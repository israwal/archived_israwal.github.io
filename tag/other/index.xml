      <title>Novel de-novo Short-Read Genome Assembler</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Ongoing (Since Jan 2021)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am working as a student researcher at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/AdvancedDataAnalyticsParallelTechnologiesLaboratory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Advanced Data Analytics and Parallel Technologies (ADAPT) Lab, BITS Pilani&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/profile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof. Poonam Goyal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sequence assemby&lt;/a&gt; is an NP-hard problem which can be modelled as a variant of string reconstruction problem. We are building a novel de-novo short-read genome assembler to reconstruct the contigs efficiently. The proposed assembler is being built with distributed and hierarchical data structures and using intermediaries, unitigs, to avoid the bottlenecks in the pipeline. We harness overlap and paired-end information along with some novel features to extend the unitigs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Computational Modelling Of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Formal Methods</title>
      <link>https://israwal.github.io/project/pbn/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Completed (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rajeshk/profile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof. Rajesh Kumar&lt;/a&gt;, Formal Methods Lab, BITS Pilani, we theoretically showed the close ties between the two popular Boolean models of stochasticity- Stochasticity in Nodes (SIN) and Stochasticity in Function (SIF). This was done by proving both the models as a special instance of a generic framework of context sensitive probabilistic Boolean networks which are modelled using discrete time markov chains. We also tried to understand the stable attractor dynamics of probabiltic networks and their physical implications as different phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optimizing Structure Of Novel Heavy Metal Complexes For Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://israwal.github.io/project/heavy_metal/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Completed (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cancer Diagnostic Tool Project is a collaboration between the Department of Biological Sciences and Department fo Chemsitry, BITS Pilani. As a part of the initiative, in-house developed backbones of novel heavy metal complex were being explored to develop affordable and portable cancer diagnostic tools. My job, under the guidance of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/shiba/profile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof. Shibasish Chowdhury&lt;/a&gt;, was to find the optimal structure of the complexes against EphB4 using molecular docking. The results from my in-silico study are being translated to the wet-lab work to test and further optimise the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysis Of Long-Distance Linked Selection In Indian Variants Of SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link>https://israwal.github.io/project/covid_genome/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://israwal.github.io/project/covid_genome/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Completed (June 2020 - Sept 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was done virtually during the fist wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://arunsethuraman.weebly.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof. Arun Sethuraman&lt;/a&gt;, California State University, San Marcos. Long range mutations are not well studied in evolutionary biology. We hypothesized that associations in long-range mutations gives more reasons to inspect causality. Such association rules were mined using apriori algorithm and their individual stability was analyzed. This was the first ever data-driven analysis of viral long-range mutations. We presented our work at the virtual poster presentation at COVID-19 Dynamics and Evolution Virtual Conference, organised by UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
